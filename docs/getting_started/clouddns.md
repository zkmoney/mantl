# GCP Cloud DNS

Terraform can use `google_dns_record_set` resources to provide DNS
records for your cluster.

In addition to the normal DNS variables \<dns\>, you will need to
specify the `managed_zone` parameter. You can find your Managed Zone
name in the GCP Netowrking Console.

![GCP Managed Zone Name example](/_static/gcp_dns.png)

If you haven't set up a managed zone for the domain you're using, you
can do that with Terraform as well, just add this extra snippet in your
.tf file:

``` sourceCode javascript
resource "google_dns_managed_zone" "managed-zone" {
  name = "my-managed-zone"
  dns_name = "example.com."
  description "Managed zone for example.com."
}
```

In your `gce.tf`, you will want to enable the cloud-dns module:

``` sourceCode javascript
module "cloud-dns" {
  source = "./terraform/gce/dns"
  control_count = "${var.control_count}"
  control_ips = "${module.control-nodes.control_ips}"
  domain = "mydomain.com"
  edge_count = "${var.edge_count}"
  edge_ips = "${module.edge-nodes.edge_ips}"
  lb_ip = "${module.network-lb.public_ip}"
  managed_zone = "my-cloud-dns-zone"
  short_name = "${var.short_name}"
  subdomain = "service"
  worker_count = "${var.worker_count}"
  worker_ips = "${module.worker-nodes.worker_ips}"
}
```
