Terraform can use CloudFlare to provide DNS records for your cluster,
independent of which provider you use to provision your servers.

## CloudFlare Username/Token

The easiest way to configure credentials for CloudFlare is by setting
environment variables:

Alternatively, you can set up the CloudFlare provider credentials in
your .tf file:

``` sourceCode shell
provider "cloudflare" {
  email = "the e-mail address for your CloudFlare account"
  token = "your CloudFlare token"
}
```
