# DigitalOcean

As of Mantl 0.3 you can bring up DigitalOcean environments using
Terraform.

## Configuring Terraform for DigitalOcean

Before we can build any servers using Terraform and Ansible, we need to
configure authentication. We'll be filling in the authentication
variables for the template located at
`terraform/digitalocean.sample.tf`. It looks like
    this:

  - \[../../terraform/digitalocean.sample.tf\](../../terraform/digitalocean.sample.tf)
    
      - language  
        javascript

Copy that file in it's entirety to the root of the project to start
customization. In the next sections, we'll explain how to obtain these
settings.

### API Key

To use DigitalOcean from Terraform, you'll need an API key. You can
create one at the API page of DigitalOcean UI.

To create a token, click "Generate New Token" in the "Personal Access
Tokens" list. Name your token (`mantl` could be a good name) and make
sure that write access is granted.

![The token creation page, making sure write access is
granted.](/_static/digitalocean_new_token.png)

Once your token is created, you will need to copy it to the "token"
field of the DigitalOcean provider. The token will only be displayed
once, so do it before refreshing the page or navigating away.

token.](/_static/digitalocean_created_token.png)

If you don't want to keep your access token in a file, you can instead
write it to an environment variable:

  - DIGITALOCEAN\_TOKEN  
    The DigitalOcean token to use for Terraform-created resources

### Regions and Sizes

As the sample notes, the region you deploy in must support metadata. All
the newer regions support this (NYC3, for instance.) If you don't use a
metadata-supported region Ansible will not know which roles to apply to
your servers.

To find out if your desired region has metadata support:

``` sourceCode shell
curl -u "$DIGITALOCEAN_KEY:" https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/regions
```

This call will return a list of objects like the following. If
`"metadata"` is in the "features" key, you can use the provided slug as
`region_name` to select it.

``` sourceCode json
{
    "name": "New York 3",
    "slug": "nyc3",
    "sizes": [
        "32gb",
        "16gb",
        "2gb",
        "1gb",
        "4gb",
        "8gb",
        "512mb",
        "64gb",
        "48gb"
    ],
    "features": [
        "private_networking",
        "backups",
        "ipv6",
        "metadata"
    ],
    "available": true
}
```

## Provisioning

Once you're all set up with the provider, customize your modules (for
`control_count` and `worker_count`), run `terraform get` to prepare
Terraform to provision your cluster, `terraform plan` to see what will
be created, and `terraform apply` to provision the cluster. Afterwards,
you can use the instructions in getting started \<index\> to install
Mantl on your new cluster.
