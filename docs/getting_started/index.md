# General Information about Mantl with Ansible

The Mantl project uses Ansible to bring up nodes and clusters. This
generally means that you need three things:

1.  Hosts to use as the base for your cluster
2.  An [inventory file](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_inventory.html)
    with the hosts you want to be modified. Mantl includes an Ansible
    inventory for terraformed hosts,
    [terraform.py](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/mantl/blob/master/plugins/inventory/terraform.py).
3.  A playbook matching Ansible roles to hosts. Mantl organizes its
    components in
    [sample.yml](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/mantl/blob/master/sample.yml),
    which we recommend copying to `mantl.yml` for the possibility of
    later customization. You can read more about
    [playbooks](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks.html) in the
    [Ansible docs](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/).

## Preparing to provision Cloud Hosts

The playbooks and roles in this project will work on whatever provider
(or metal) you care to spin up, as long as it can run CentOS 7 or
equivalent.

Your hosts will have to be accessible with your SSH key. If you're
unfamiliar with SSH keys, please read [DigitalOcean's guide to setting
up SSH
keys](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2).

Here are some guides specific to each of the platforms that Mantl
supports:

There are several preparatory steps to provisioning the cloud hosts that
are common to all providers:

### Step 1: Copy .tf file

You will need to copy the .tf file of the platform you are using from
[mantl/terraform/](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/mantl/tree/master/terraform)
to the root of the project. For example,
`mantl/terraform/openstack-modules.sample.tf` will need to be copied to
`mantl/openstack-module-sample.tf`. The variables in the copied .tf file
will need to be changed to your configuration.

> **note**
> 
> More than one .tf file in the mantl directory will lead to errors upon
> deployment. Since Mantl initially does not support multiple
> datacenters, extra .tf files will need to be renamed or moved. If you
> would like to add multiple datacenters see the [Consul
> docs](https://www.consul.io/docs/guides/datacenters.html) for more
> information.

### Step 2: Run security-setup

Running the `security-setup` script in the root directory will set up
passwords, authentication, and certificates. For more information, see
/security/security\_setup documentation.

### Step 3: Set up DNS records

You can set up your DNS records with Terraform. See dns.

## Deploying software via Ansible

> **note**
> 
>   - Ansible requres a Python 2 binary. If yours is not at
>     /usr/bin/python,  
>     please view the [Ansible FAQ](http://docs.ansible.com/faq.html).
>     You can add an extra variable to the following commands, e.g.
>     `ansible -e ansible_python_interpreter=/path/to/python2`.

The following steps assume that you have provisioned your cloud host by
taking the steps listed in one of the guides above.

This project ships with a dynamic inventory file to read Terraform
`.tfstate` files,
[terraform.py](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/mantl/blob/master/plugins/inventory/terraform.py).
If you are not running Ansible from the root directory or would like to
use a custom inventory file, you can use the `-i` argument of `ansible`
or `ansible-playbook` to specify the inventory file path.

``` sourceCode shell
ansible-playbook -i path/to/inventory -e @security.yml mantl.yml
```

### Step 1: Add password to the ssh-agent

For the next steps, you may want to [add your password to the
ssh-agent](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=SSH_keys&redirect=no#SSH_agents)
avoid re-entering your password.

### Step 2: Ping the servers to ensure they are reachable via ssh

``` sourceCode shell
ansible all -m ping
```

It may take a few minutes after running terraform for the servers to be
reachable. If any servers fail to connect, you can check your connection
by adding `-vvvv` for verbose SSH debugging to view the errors in more
detail.

### Step 3: Upgrade packages

> **warning**
> 
> Due to updated packages in the recent CentOS 7 (1511) release, it is
> critical that you upgrade operating system packages on all servers
> before proceeding with the deployment:

``` sourceCode shell
ansible-playbook playbooks/upgrade-packages.yml
```

If you neglect to upgrade packages, you will likely experience multiple
failures, particularly around Consul. See issues
[907](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/mantl/issues/907) and
[927](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/mantl/issues/927) for more details.

### Step 4: Deploy the software

First, you will need to customize a playbook. A sample can be found at
`sample.yml` in the root directory which you can copy to `mantl.yml`.
You can find more about customizing this at
[playbooks](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks.html). You'll want
to change `consul_acl_datacenter` to your preferred ACL datacenter. If
you only have one datacenter, you can remove this variable.

Next, assuming you've placed the filled-out template at `mantl.yml`:

``` sourceCode shell
ansible-playbook -e @security.yml mantl.yml
```

The deployment will probably take a while as all tasks are completed.

## Checking your deployment

Once your deployment has completed, you will be able to access the Mantl
UI in your browser by connecting to one of the control nodes.

If you need the IP address of your nodes, you can use `terraform.py`:

``` sourceCode shell
$ python2 plugins/inventory/terraform.py --hostfile
## begin hosts generated by terraform.py ##
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx         mantl-control-01
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx         mantl-control-02
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx         mantl-control-03
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx         mantl-edge-01
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx         mantl-edge-02
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx         mantl-worker-001
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx         mantl-worker-002
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx         mantl-worker-003
## end hosts generated by terraform.py ##
```

When you enter a control node's IP address into your browser, you'll
likely get prompted about invalid security certificates (if you have
SSL/TLS turned on). Follow your browser's instructions on how to access
a site without valid certs. Then, you will be presented with a basic
access authentication prompt. The username and password for this are the
ones generated by `security-setup`, and are stored in `security.yml` if
you forgot them.

Here is what you should be looking at after you connect and
authenticate:

### Customizing your deployment

Below are guides customizing your deployment:

### Restarting your deployment

To restart your deployment and make sure all components are restarted
and working correctly, use the `playbooks/reboot-hosts.yml` playbook.

``` sourceCode shell
ansible-playbook playbooks/reboot-hosts.yml
```

### Using a Docker Container to Provision your Cluster

You can also provision your cluster by running a docker container. See
dockerfile for more information.
