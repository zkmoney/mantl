Your customized `mantl.yml`
[playbook](http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks.html) should be used to

Run this playbook with `ansible-playbook -i
plugins/inventory/terraform.py -e @security.yml
/path/to/your/playbook.yml`. It will take a while for everything to come
up as fresh machines will have to download quite a few dependencies.
