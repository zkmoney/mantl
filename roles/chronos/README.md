# Chronos

> **note**
> 
> new in version 0.1

[Chronos](http://mesos.github.io/chronos/) is a distributed and
fault-tolerant scheduler that runs on top of Apache Mesos that can be
used for job orchestration. You can think of it as distributed cron
service. It supports custom Mesos executors as well as the default
command executor. By default, Chronos executes sh (on most systems bash)
scripts.

## Installation

As of 1.1, Chronos is distributed as an addon for Mantl. After a
successful initial build (from your customized `sample.yml`), you can
install it by running:

``` sourceCode shell
ansible-playbook addons/chronos.yml
```

It can take a few minutes before Chronos becomes available and healthy.

## Accessing the Chronos User Interface

After Chronos has been successfully installed and initialized, it should
be possible to access the user interface directly from Mantl UI.

## Default Configuration

The default configuration of the Chronos addon will require at 1 worker
node with at least 1 CPU and 1 GB of memory available.

## Customizing your Installation

There are a number of configuration options available for Chronos (each
documented in the Variables section below).

As an example, let's say you wanted to run 3 Chronos instances for
high-availability purposes and you wanted each to have more CPU and
memory allocated. To do this, create a new yaml file (`chronos.yml`, for
example) that looks something like this:

``` sourceCode yaml
---
chronos_instances: 3
chronos_cpus: 2.0
chronos_mem: 2048.0
```

When you install the Chronos addon, you can tell ansible to use this
yaml file to configure your installation:

``` sourceCode shell
ansible-playbook -e @chronos.yml addons/chronos.yml
```

## Uninstalling the Chronos addon

Uninstalling the Chronos addon can be done with a single API call. For
example:

``` sourceCode shell
export creds='admin:password'
export url=https://mantl-control-01

# uninstall chronos framework
curl -sku $creds -XDELETE -d "{\"name\": \"chronos\"}" $url/api/1/install
```

You will need to adjust the `creds` and `url` variables with values that
are applicable to your cluster.

## Upgrading from 1.0

If you are upgrading from a Mantl 1.0 cluster that is already running
Chronos, there is actually little reason to switch over to the addon
version that runs in Marathon. Feel free to continue using your existing
Chronos installation. However, if for some reason you want to switch,
you can run the following steps to disable the existing Chronos install.

> **warning**
> 
> Please note that you will need to recreate any tasks you already have
> scheduled in Chronos. They will not be automatically
migrated.

``` sourceCode shell
ansible 'role=control' -s -m shell -a 'consul-cli service-deregister chronos'
ansible 'role=control' -s -m shell -a 'rm /etc/consul/chronos.json'
ansible 'role=control' -s -m service -a 'name=chronos enabled=no state=stopped'
```

The new method of installing Chronos requires a version of mantl-api
later than 0.1.7. You can upgrade mantl-api manually, or run a sample
playbook from a more recent version of Mantl (after 1.0.4) to get it.
After upgrading mantl-api, you can install the addon in the usual way:

``` sourceCode shell
ansible-playbook addons/chronos.yml
```
