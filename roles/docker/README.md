[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a container manager and scheduler.
In their words, it "allows you to package an application with all of its
dependencies into a standardized unit for software development." Their
site has [more on what Docker is](https://www.docker.com/what-docker).
We use it in Mantl to ship units of work around the cluster, combined
with marathon's scheduling.

## Using a private Docker registry

In addition to the open, official Docker registry at
<https://hub.docker.com>, one can use a private in-house docker registry
for storing and pulling images. Docker Hub also supports storing private
images.

One must configure credentials in order to use private repositories.
This is done with the security-setup script, run it with the flag
`--use-private-docker-registry=true`. It will then ask you for username,
password and e-mail address for the registry user. You can also specify
a custom URL for an in-house Docker registry, or omit it, in which case
it will default to the official registry, <https://index.docker.io/v1/>.

In addition to configuring access to the specified private docker
registries, this will also create an archive that can be used to supply
credentials to Marathon tasks that require access to those registries.
You can specify the path to the generated credentials archive in the
`uris` key of your Marathon app definition:

``` sourceCode json
...
"uris": [
  "file:///etc/docker.tar.gz"
],
...
```

See the [Marathon
documentation](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/native-docker-private-registry.html)
for more information.
