# Mesos

[Mesos](https://mesos.apache.org/) is the distributed system kernel that
manages resources across multiple nodes. When combined with marathon,
you can basically think of it as a distributed init system.

## Modes

Mesos can be run in one of two "modes":

>   - A server mode (called "master" or "leader")
>   - A client mode (called "follower" or "agent". The term "slave" is
>     used but deprecated.)

This project prefers the "leader/follower nomenclature". In addition to
the "official" modes described below, mesos\_mode supports running both
modes on a single machine for testing or development scenarios.

### Leader

Leaders will communicate with each other via zookeeper to coordinate
which leader controls the cluster. Because of this, you can run as many
leader nodes as you like, but you should consider keeping an odd number
in the cluster to make attaining a quorum easier. A single leader node
will also work fine, but will not be highly available.

### Follower

Follower nodes need to know where the leaders are, and there can be any
number of them. You should keep the follower machines free of "heavier"
services running outside Mesos, as this will cause inaccurate resource
availability counts in the cluster.

## Upgrading

> **note**
> 
> new in version 1.0

If you are running Mantl 0.5.1, you'll need to run the
`playbooks/upgrade-mesos-marathon.yml` playbook before reprovisioning
your cluster to 1.0. The packaging format changed in the 1.0 release,
this will ensure a smooth upgrade.

Upgrades from releases prior to Mantl 0.5.1 have not been tested.

## Variables

You can use these variables to customize your Mesos installation.

  - mesos\_mode  
    Set to `leader` for leader mode, and `follower` for follower mode.
    Set to `mixed` to run both leader and follower on the same machine
    (useful for development or testing.)
    
    default: `follower`

  - mesos\_log\_dir  
    default: `/var/log/mesos`

  - mesos\_work\_dir  
    default: `/var/run/mesos`

  - mesos\_leader\_port  
    default: `5050`

  - mesos\_follower\_port  
    default: `5051`

  - mesos\_leader\_cmd  
    default: `mesos-master`

  - mesos\_follower\_cmd  
    default: `mesos-slave`

  - mesos\_attributes Set attributes for mesos agents.  
    Provide these as a list to set multiple attributes. Format: `-
    "key:value" - "key:value"`
    
    default: `node_id:{{ inventory_hostname }}`

  - mesos\_resources  
    Set resources for mesos agents. (useful for setting available ports
    that applications can be bound to). Provide these as a list to set
    multiple resources. Format: `- name(role):value -
    name(role):value...`
    
    default:
    `ports(*):[4000-5000, 7000-8000, 9000-10000, 25000-26000, 31000-32000]`

  - mesos\_cluster  
    default: `mantl`

  - mesos\_zk\_hosts  
    A ZooKeeper connection string in the the `host:mesos_zk_port`
    format, generated from the hosts in `zookeeper_server_group`.

  - mesos\_zk\_dns  
    Consul DNS entries for ZooKeeper hosts.
    
    default: `zookeeper.service.consul`

  - mesos\_zk\_port  
    default: `2181`

  - mesos\_zk\_chroot  
    ZooKeeper znode to use as a base for mesos data.
    
    default: `mesos`

  - mesos\_credentials  
    A list of credentials to add for authentication. These should be in
    the form `{ principal: "...", secret: "..." }`.
    
    default: `[]`

  - mesos\_authenticate\_frameworks  
    Enable Mesos authentication for frameworks. You should set
    mesos\_credentials for credentials if this is set.
    
    default: set automatically if framework credentials are present

  - mesos\_authenticate\_followers  
    Enable Mesos authentication from followers. If set, each follower
    will need mesos\_follower\_secret set in their host variables.
    
    default: set automatically if follower credentials are present

  - mesos\_follower\_principal  
    The principal to use for follower authentication
    
    default: `follower`

  - mesos\_follower\_secret  
    The secret to use for follower authentication
    
    default: not set. Set this to enable follower authentication.

  - mesos\_logging\_level  
    The log level for Mesos. This is set for all components.
    
    Default: `WARNING`
