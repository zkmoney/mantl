> new in version 0.1

[ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) is used for coordination
among Mesos and Marathon nodes. Rather than storing things in this
service yourself, you should prefer consul.

## Variables

You can use these variables to customize your ZooKepeer installation.

    provided it will be set by the playbook.
